## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Config Corruption**: Always backup, use atomic writes
- **Network Issues**: Add retries, offline fallbacks
- **Platform Differences**: Extensive CI testing
- **Version Conflicts**: Clear error messages, manual override

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity**: Progressive disclosure, smart defaults
- **Errors**: Always provide actionable next steps
- **Performance**: Cache aggressively, show progress
- **Breaking Changes**: Version config format, migration tools
