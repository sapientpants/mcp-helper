# CI Build Optimizations

## Performance Improvements

### 1. **Compilation Caching with sccache**
- Uses Mozilla's sccache for distributed compilation caching
- Caches compilation artifacts across builds
- Significantly speeds up incremental builds
- Works across different CI runs

### 2. **Improved Dependency Caching**
- Uses `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` with enhanced options:
  - `cache-all-crates`: Caches all dependencies, not just workspace
  - `cache-on-failure`: Preserves cache even on failed builds
  - Caches `~/.cargo/bin/` for installed tools
  - Separate cache keys per OS/Rust version

### 3. **Faster Tool Installation** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Uses `cargo-binstall` to download pre-built binaries
- Avoids compiling tools from source
- Tools like cargo-audit and cargo-tarpaulin install in seconds vs minutes
- Reduces CI tool installation time by ~95%

### 4. **Build Parallelization**
- Added `quick-checks` job that runs first
- Other jobs depend on quick-checks and run in parallel
- Fail-fast on formatting/simple issues

### 5. **Optimized Rust Flags**
```yaml
RUSTFLAGS: "-D warnings -C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"
```
- Uses LLD linker (faster than default)
- Treats warnings as errors consistently

### 6. **Additional Environment Variables**
- `CARGO_NET_RETRY: 10` - More retries for flaky networks
- `CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI: true` - More reliable git fetches
- `CARGO_INCREMENTAL: 0` - Disabled for CI (saves space, more deterministic)

## Expected Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- Cold build: ~3-5 minutes per platform
- Warm build: ~2-3 minutes per platform
- Tool installation: ~2-4 minutes

### After Optimizations:
- Cold build: ~2-3 minutes per platform
- Warm build: ~30-60 seconds per platform
- Tool installation: ~10-30 seconds ✅ (cargo-binstall implemented)

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Gradual rollout**: Keep both workflows initially
2. **Monitor performance**: Compare build times
3. **Iterate**: Fine-tune cache keys and settings

## Cache Size Management

The improved caching will use more storage but GitHub provides 10GB free:
- Cargo registry: ~200-500MB
- sccache: ~500MB-1GB per platform
- Dependencies: ~100-300MB per configuration

## Maintenance Notes

- Update `MSRV` in matrix when changing minimum Rust version
- Clear caches if seeing corrupted build artifacts
- Monitor sccache hit rates in build logs
- Consider self-hosted runners for even better caching
